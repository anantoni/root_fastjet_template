root_fastjet_template
=====================

A C++ project template for usage with the ROOT and Fastjet libraries

Current version links with the ROOT libraries, the fastjet libraries and a user created C++ shared library generated by libtool.

Instructions on lxplus:

1) you need to run cmsenv (you know that).
2) install fastjet
3) set the environment for fastjet and for the user created C++ shared library of the project
export PATH=PATH:/path/to/fastjet-installation/bin
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/path/to/fastjet-installation/lib:/path/to/root_fastjet_template/lib/.libs

<project_root_dir>/lib/.libs is the directory where libtool generates both the static and shared libraries of the project that's why you need to add that to the linker too

What I added to my .bashrc:
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/afs/cern.ch/user/a/anantoni/fastjet-install/lib/:/afs/cern.ch/user/a/anantoni/projects/root_fastjet_template/lib/.libs
export PATH=$PATH://afs/cern.ch/user/a/anantoni/fastjet-install/bin

4) run ./configure
5) run make
6) execute binary: bin/root_fastjet_template < bin/single-event.dat
